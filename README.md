Banding Kampus (College Comparing System)

Fullstack web comparing system using PHP, Mysql & Bootstrap.

What's in the packaging?
- PHP as the main backend code
- Bootstrap as the frontend interfaces
- Mysql as the main databases center

I used to code native php with a bunch of OOP structure in it using MVC methods.
